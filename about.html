        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Ginger Taylor. I was born in Liberia and moved to the United States when I was 7 years old. 
           I am the oldest of 4 kids. I am 20 years old and I go to the University of Rhode Island in Kingston, RI.
           I am majoring in Computer Science to achieve my dream of becoming a Software Engineer.

        <h1>Hobbies</h1>
        <p>My top hobbies are spending time with my family and friends, dancing, cooking, and self-care.
            If you ask any of the people that I am close with they would say that I am family-orientated. I love to 
            make people around me feel loved and supported no matter what they do. I have always been passionate about 
            dancing from an early age. My favorite types of dance are Ballet and Contemporary. Apart from dancing, I love to 
            cook and try new recipes from different cultures and that is how I show my love to the people that I love. 
            This is one of the ways that I like to learn. I realize over the years that I tend to forget about my feelings and put 
            other people before my own. I know that is not right for my mental health, but as the oldest and the first born in
            a black family it is hard not to do that. To solve this problem I like to dedicate one day out of the week to just focus on my health. To 
            do this I like to read the Bible, do skin-care, read, or color.

        <h1>Interests</h1>
        <p>There are many things that pique my interest, but the one thing that I am sure of is starting my own business/Non-Profit.
            From a young age to now I have always wanted to help people but I did not want to enter the healthcare feild. My plan is to help people 
            who are not able to help themselves and are struggling to make a living for themselves.
